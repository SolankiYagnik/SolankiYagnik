### Welcome to Yagnik Solanki profile! 👋


- 🔭 I’m currently working on Building responsive and accessible websites using the latest technologies like React, Vue, Node.js, and Laravel. I'm especially focused on improving user experience and incorporating progressive web app (PWA) features into my projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Advanced CSS techniques and exploring the capabilities of Vue.js. I'm also diving deeper into backend development with a focus on RESTful API design.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Projects that are geared towards social impact, particularly those that leverage technology to improve education or environmental sustainability. I love working in teams where I can both share my knowledge and learn from others.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Understanding containerization and orchestration with Docker and Kubernetes. I'm relatively new to these technologies and would greatly appreciate mentorship or resources.
- 💬 Ask me about Web development best practices, JavaScript frameworks, and how to manage state in large-scale applications. I’m also happy to share my experience with freelancing and working remotely.
